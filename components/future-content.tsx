      <p>Trading has come a long way.</p>
      <p>
        From shouting across stock floors to tapping on phones — the internet changed everything. Now, over 100 million
        people trade globally using digital platforms. It's fast, accessible, and global.
      </p>
      <p className="font-semibold text-lg">But the next leap is bigger:</p>
      <p className="text-xl font-display font-bold mt-4 mb-6">
        The rise of Financial Intelligence — where AI becomes your edge.
      </p>

      <p>At Qantora, we believe the future of trading is built on:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>AI-powered decision support</li>
        <li>Data-driven education</li>
        <li>Community-backed strategies</li>
        <li>Accessible, adaptive trading tools</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="mt-6">We imagine a world where:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Traders don't guess — they know.</li>
        <li>Trading isn't lonely — it's social and supported.</li>
        <li>Growth isn't accidental — it's engineered through clarity.</li>
      </ul>

      <div className="bg-gray-50 p-4 rounded-lg my-6">
        <p className="italic text-center">
          And maybe in this future, it's just:
          <br />A trader, their dog, and an AI assistant reviewing trades over breakfast. 🐶📈🤖
        </p>
      </div>

      <p className="font-semibold">Jokes aside — this is serious.</p>

      <p>We're building a platform that brings:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Intelligence to the individual</li>
        <li>Structure to the strategy</li>
        <li>Vision to your investing</li>
      </ul>

      <p className="text-lg font-display font-bold mt-6">
        The future of trading isn't about luck —
        <br />
        It's about precision, learning, and evolution.
      </p>

      <p className="text-lg font-semibold">Qantora is here to guide that shift.</p>
